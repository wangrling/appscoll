/**
 * This class creates pools of background threads for downloading
 * 500px images from the web, based on URLs retrieved from 500px's featured images RSS feed.
 * The class is implemented as a singleton; the only way to get an PhotoManager instance is to
 * call {@link #getInstance}.
 * <p>
 * The class sets the pool size and cache size based on the particular operation it's performing.
 * The algorithm doesn't apply to all situations, so if you re-use the code to implement a pool
 * of threads for your own app, you will have to come up with your choices for pool size, cache
 * size, and so forth. In many cases, you'll have to set some numbers arbitrarily and then
 * measure the impact on performance.
 * <p>
 * This class actually uses two threadpools in order to limit the number of
 * simultaneous image decoding threads to the number of available processor
 * cores.
 * <p>
 * Finally, this class defines a handler that communicates back to the UI
 * thread to change the bitmap to reflect the state.
